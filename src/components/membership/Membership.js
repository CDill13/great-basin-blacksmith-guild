                    <h3>Family Membership</h3>
                    <p>Any GBBG member who is accompanied by a family member of the same household who attends meetings and conferences solely as a companion would be considered a nonactive member at no additional charge. (meals etc. would need to be paid) A GBBG member who is regularly accompanied by a family member in the same household to gain additional knowledge and to further develop their blacksmithing skills would qualify for a family membership of $30.00 rather than the usual $20.00. The first active member would pay full price for the conference and the additional active member would pay Â½ the conference fee. A family membership would entitle one additional family member to participate in workshop as long as they worked jointly on one project at no additional charge. If both family active members choose to work on separate projects they will be expected to pay for two workshop fees at the full price. All youth members (under 18) need to be accompanied by an adult at all times during meetings, workshops and projects and no under the age of 18 is permitted to use any machinery.</p>
